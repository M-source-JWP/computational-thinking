# computational-thinking
This is an excerpt of the practical portion of my Computational Thinking curriculum made for The C.O.D.E Initiative, showcased with permission. The entire curriculum spans across 5 one-hour lessons, and aims to teach students about various computer science concepts such as image representation, algorithms, and binary using practical exercises and a written curriculum for a student and their CODEinitiative volunteer teacher.

This lesson in particular deals with image representation, and so the .py code file deal with translating information in custom data structures into blocks in a student's Minecraft world, using Minecraft Education Edition's Agent and in-game code editor - the python code can also be translated into code block format in game to make it easier to comprehend for younger students.


## Lesson 2 - Image representation 
(Adapated from https://classic.csunplugged.org/image-representation/)

In this lesson, students will learn about how pixels are used to represent images, and use two kinds of pixel formats and their corresponding minecraft interpreters:
1:1 pixel, where each row of pixels are represented with an number array of the same length, so that each number in the array corresponds to a pixel in the image
“Fax” pixel, where each row of pixels is represented by only a few numbers that dictate where drawn pixels start, and for how long they continue for (example here)

Learning goals - Understand that all data in a modern digital computer is just a series of zeroes and ones - and through different levels of abstraction, we can go from basic, machine language to complex languages, to visual interfaces.

Lesson outline:
Since today’s focus is on images, explain the concept of how images are composed of tiny pixels and introduce the black and white 1:1 pixel drawer. Then introduce the mini-RGB system. to the 1:1 pixel drawer, and the data system.

Then, ask the student to interpret and draw progressively more complicated data into images to reinforce the need for time-saving compression.
Then introduce the concept of compression, using the fax pixel system, and efficiency in data transfers. Reintroduce interpreting and drawing the same difficult pictures, made easier from the fax system

Now, introduce the problems with compression - Have the student convert various minecraft scenes into the pixel fax system, after which the volunteer will check their work using the coded drawer. Have the student learn that with compression, data is usually lost. (Make sure to follow up the abstracted minecraft teaching with more grounded real life applications.)
